<h1>About Eli</h1>
<p>Eli is an automated course recommendation system for Yale students with the collective knowledge of hundreds of students' experiences at Yale. It considers a user's preferences in searching through course descriptions, reviews, and professors in order to find a class that is right for you. It even tells you why each class was selected for you. The bottom line is that when there are roughly 8,333,291,666,700 ways to select a schedule of five classes next semester, it's good to have a little help picking them.</p>
